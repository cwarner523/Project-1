## Explanations of the Technologies Used

Throughout the project I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I made all of my buttons and components of the game in html, and styled them in CSS. I used CSS to also create the illusion that the buttons being pressed to mimic the game are lighting up. In my Javascript I decided to use Jquery instead of Vanilla JS. I feel that this was something that I liked better, and was easier for me to use in my code.

## Approach Taken

At first I designed my wireframes to look exactly how I wanted my game to look. I then used an actual picture of the Simon game to recreate it in HTML and CSS and make the game look as realistic as possible. This was a really fun part of the project for me. I then wrote out all the steps and functions that I would need in order to execute the game. This really helped when starting to write my code because I previously thought out the logic of how the game would turn out. In the purposes of the game, I made it end at 6 turns for now in order to show that after the user successfull copied the pattern 6 times, all the buttons will light up and the counter will say "WINNER".

## User Stories

You can click the same buttont that the computer generated and then if the click is correct, the game will generate a new addition to the pattern

## How-to-use Instructions

The user will press the start button, then one of the colors will light up. The user must press the same button that the computer randomly generated. This pattern will continue until the user pressed the wrong button and breaks the pattern that the randomizer has created. 

## Unsolved Problems
The one thing that was the hardest for me was figuring out the setTimeout function to work successfully. I got the lights to blink in the order of the computer randomizer one by one up until turn 4 or 5. Sometimes it works longer than others, but this was definately a challenge for me.
