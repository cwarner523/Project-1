# Simon Says Proposal

## What is Simon Says?

Simon Says is a memory game, with 4 colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). One of the colors will light up, and the user must click
the button with the same color. 

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

## Links and Resources

(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using.)
