# Simon Says Proposal

## What is Simon Says?

Simon Says is a memory game, with 4 colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). One of the colors will light up, and the user must click
the button with the same color. The game will continue, and the user will have to continuously click the right buttons with the same color combination that has been created. The game will end once the user does not create the correct combination.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

The challenges I expect to encounter is writing the logic so the code knows that the user clicked the correct color, and randomizing the color that will show up.

## Phases of Completion

I will have to complete the board game render through HTML and CSS, and then I am going to figure out how to get the game to pick a random color, and have the user repeat the color that was randomly chosen. I am going to have to write out each step in which both the computer will operate in order for the color to be chosen, as well as the steps it will take the the user to pick the color that was chosen, and have the game remember the pattern, and know if the user picked the right color.
